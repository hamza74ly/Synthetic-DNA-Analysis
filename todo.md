## Todo List

### Phase 1: Project planning and dataset selection
- [ ] Identify suitable data science project ideas.
- [ ] Select a dataset that is publicly available and suitable for analysis and visualization.

### Phase 2: Data collection and exploration
- [x] Download or collect the selected dataset.
- [x] Perform initial data exploration (e.g., check data types, missing values, basic statistics).

### Phase 3: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- [x] Handle missing values.
- [x] Clean and transform data as necessary.
- [x] Feature engineering (if applicable).

### Phase 4: Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- [x] Perform EDA to uncover patterns and insights.
- [x] Create various data visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots).

### Phase 5: Statistical analysis and modeling
- [x] Apply appropriate statistical methods or machine learning models.
- [x] Evaluate model performance.

### Phase 6: Results interpretation and insights
- [x] Interpret the findings from the analysis and modeling.
- [x] Extract actionable insights.

### Phase 7: Professional report generation
- [x] Structure and write a professional report summarizing the project.
- [x] Include methodology, findings, visualizations, and conclusions.

### Phase 8: Project packaging and delivery
- [ ] Organize project files (code, data, report).
- [ ] Prepare for delivery (e.g., create a README file, package into a zip archive).
